## 18MR.org

18MR is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization fiscally sponsored by CEL Education Fund (CELEF) — launched in September 2012 and, in less than two years, has become the premier hub for Asian American–Pacific Islander (AAPI) civic engagement and community expression online. America’s first national organization to serve AAPI communities, we create digital vehicles for civic engagement, pioneer ways to maximize technology and social media as platforms for social change, and amplify the voices of the country’s fastest growing demographic. During the 2012 election cycle, 18MR.org built and distributed online voter registration tools to more than 80 partner groups, and ran social media–fueled civic engagement campaigns with dozens of AAPI community organizations and media outlets nationwide.

Our culturally savvy campaigns and aptitude for building and implementing technology, combined with a network of social media influencers, artists, and established AAPI organizations, keep us well-poised to ensure that AAPIs are an active part of the civic fabric of the United States. Through social media, 18MR.org reaches more than 35,000 people every day and has built a volunteer network of nearly 20,000 AAPIs in every state. Young leaders in our network are members of some of the most powerful youth networks in the country, including Youngist, Freedom Side, Dream Defenders, Million Hoodies Movement for Justice, BYP100, and National Student Power Convergence.

## Rock the Vote

Rock the Vote is the nation’s largest organization engaging and building the political power of young people in politics. Founded nearly 25 years ago in response to a wave of attacks on freedom of speech and artistic expression, Rock the Vote uses music, popular culture, and cutting-edge technologies to engage and mobilize young people to have a voice in the democratic process.
