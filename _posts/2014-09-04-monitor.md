While voter disenfranchisement looks very different today than it did 50 years ago, it’s still a serious problem for many communities of color – including Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. But how do you know if you’ve witnessed or been a victim of voting discrimination? 

Marcia Johnson-Blanco, co-director of the [Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights’s Voting Rights Projects](http://www.lawyerscommittee.org/projects/voting_rights/) suggests that discrimination is much more subtle than it was in the past, saying, “We need to look at what we call second-generation barriers, how laws have a negative impact on minorities’ ability to vote, and what that means.”

Below are some examples of barriers to voting:

+ Photo ID laws, or proof of citizenship requirements
+ Redrawn districts that dilute minority votes
+ Reduced early-voting hours that limit poll access
+ Limited voting hours, often overlapping normal daytime work hours
+ Laws mandating additional documentation that require voters pay to obtain copies of identity documents
+ Lack of in-language materials or on-site translation

If you’ve observed or experienced any of these things at the polls, you’ve had a run in with voter discrimination. Let us know about by submitting a report. We’ll add your story (anonymized to protect your identity and/or the victim’s identity) to our collection. If you want further assistance, we are happy to connect you with an advocacy group working to make voting fair, accessible, and equitable for all voters.
