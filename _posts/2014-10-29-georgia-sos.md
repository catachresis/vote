__With less than a day left until Election Day, 40,000 Georgians could lose their chance to vote__ – and the Georgia Secretary of State, Brian Kemp, is doing nothing to stop this.

The 40,000 people in question registered to vote in Georgia only to have their names go missing on state voter rolls. As if it wasn’t bad enough that these potential new voters may never have the chance to cast their ballots, but __they represent Asian, Black, and Latino communities__ from around Columbus, Atlanta, and Savannah.

__There is no way around it: These 40,000 “missing” voter registrations are part of racially biased voter suppression.__ _We cannot let this happen._

Secretary of State Kemp continues to fail to answer any investigative inquiries regarding these 40,000 new voter registrations. In fact, Kemp now claims that there is no proof of missing voter registrations – even though grassroots groups and activists leading on-the-ground voter engagement have said that the number of new voters registered falls far below the numbers of registrations that were turned over to the state.

Instead of honoring the knowledge and work of those who have shed blood, sweat, and tears to register new voters, __the state of Georgia is choosing to squelch the power of marginalized communities in an attempt to impact the election.__

At a time when there are so many issues impacting communities of color – from education to housing to jobs to internet regulations – we cannot lay down and let 40,000 potential votes disappear into thin air. 

We have power, and a lot of it. Let’s use that power to make a difference for not just Georgia voters, but for for voters all across the country who are also facing voter intimidation and suppression.

__Demand that the DOJ secure the freedom to vote in Georgia – for everyone.__
