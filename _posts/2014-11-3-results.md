## The Asian American Election Eve Poll

Asian Americans remain a solidly Democratic segment of the electorate, with a diverse set of policy views, and are becoming pivotal in key races. The Asian American Election Eve Poll, a pioneering partnership between
 Asian American Decisions and the AAPI Civic Engagement Fund, interviewed 1,150 Asian Americans between Oct. 30th and Nov. 4th in a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, nationally representative survey with targeted samples 
 of Asian Americans in California, Texas, and Virginia. Some key highlights on vote patterns, key issues, and 2016 are shown below.
